This project solves systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination.

The program reads matrices from {\ttfamily .in} files, performs Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, determines the rank and consistency of the system, and displays the solution. It allows multiple runs and interacts with the user for input and exit control.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{index_autotoc_md0}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting
\item Rank determination and consistency check
\item Handles cases with no solution, unique solution, or infinitely many solutions

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Provide a matrix in an {\ttfamily .in} file.
\item The program reads the matrix and applies Gaussian elimination.
\item The user can run the program multiple times.
