\subsection{题目描述}
\noindent Use the file called \texttt{sunspots.txt}, which contains the observed number of sunspots on the Sun for each month since January 1749. Write a program to calculate the Fourier transform of the sunspot data and then make a graph of the magnitude squared \( |c_k|^2 \) of the Fourier coefficients as a function of \( k \)—also called the power spectrum of the sunspot signal. You should see that there is a noticeable peak in the power spectrum at a nonzero value of \( k \). Find the approximate value of \( k \) to which the peak corresponds. What is the period of the sine wave with this value of \( k \)?

\noindent \textit{Special note:} You may use any built-in functions for the Fourier transform.
