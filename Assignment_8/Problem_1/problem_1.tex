\noindent
Consider the Poisson equation:
\[
    \nabla^2 \varphi(x, y) = -\frac{\rho(x, y)}{\varepsilon_0}
\]
from electrostatics on a rectangular geometry with \(x \in [0, L_x]\) and \(y \in [0, L_y]\). Write a program that solves this equation using the relaxation method and test your program with the following cases:

\noindent
(a) \(\rho(x, y) = 0\), \(\varphi(0, y) = \varphi(L_x, y) = \varphi(x, 0) = 0\), \(\varphi(x, L_y) = 1 \, \text{V}\),
\(L_x = 1 \, \text{m}\), and \(L_y = 1.5 \, \text{m}\);

\noindent
(b) \(\frac{\rho(x, y)}{\varepsilon_0} = 1 \, \text{V/m}^2\), \(\varphi(0, y) = \varphi(L_x, y) = \varphi(x, 0) = \varphi(x, L_y) = 0\), and \(L_x = L_y = 1 \, \text{m}\).
